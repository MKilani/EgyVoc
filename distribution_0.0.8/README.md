## Introduction

EgyVoc uses Coptic forms and Group Writing spelling to authomatically reconstructs the Early New Kingdom vocalization of Ancient Egyptian words.

EgyVoc can reconstruct the vocalization on the basis of various combinations of data, namely:

* Sahidic form
* Sahidic form and Egyptian consonantal root (for a more accurate reconstruction of the consonants)
* Group Writing spellings (with attestations from at least one period)
* Sahidic form and Group Writing Spellings (and Egyptian consonantal root)

As a general rule, the more data are provided, the more accurate the reconstruction will be. However, in some cases a complete reconstruction can be obtained just on the basis of the Sahidic form, or of just one Group Writing spellings, while in others it iwll not be possible to obtain a full, precise reconstruction even when all the data are available. Each word is different, and each case needs to be considered individually.

The format of the input and of the output is discussed here below.

The algorithm is able to recongnize irregularities in the correspondes between the forms - in that case, an error message is output instead of the reconstruction.

The possibility to use also data from other Coptic dialects and from W-orthography spellings (see [Kilani 2017](references/bibliography.md)) will also be included in future releases.

The vocalization is reconstructed according to mainstream models (see E.g. Loprieno 1995), and the Group Writing spellings are distributed into 4 periods and they are read and analysed according to [Kilani 2019](http://widmaier-verlag.de/index.php?content=issue&isbn=978-3-943955-20-0).

Unstressed vowels are reduced to /…ô/ during Period 2, or even earlier.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3.

### Installing

The python package can be installed through pip:

```shell
pip3 install EgyVoc==0.0.8
```

Two commands need to be called. First, one needs to initialize the FAAL aligning algorithm (for FAAL, see [Kilani 2020](references/bibliography.md) and my github repository at [FAAL](https://github.com/MKilani/FAAL)). Then EgyVoc can be called. Here a minimal working example:

```python
from EgyVoc import EgyVoc
from EgyVoc import initializeFAAL

initializeFAAL()

results = EgyVoc(SahidicWord = "œ©‚≤ì‚≤É‚≤±‚≤ì", verbose = True )

print("Results as a Python Dictionary:")
print (results)
```

## Input

The algorithm can takes a series of arguments as input, namely:

* SahidicForm
* EgyptianRoot
* GW_Period_1
* GW_Period_2
* GW_Period_3
* GW_Period_4
* verbose

All the arguments are optional.
The argument "verbose" is a boolean that indicates if the algorithm should output data while performing the calcualtions or not.
It can be omitted, in which case it is set by default to True.

### Input - Sahidic Form

The Sahidic Form needs to be input as a Unicode string, e.g.:

```python
SahidicForm = "‚≤•‚≤±‚≤ß‚≤ô"
```

### Input - Egyptian Root

The Egyptian Root needs to be input as a Unicode string. The unicode characters Íú£, Íú•, ·πØ, ·∏è, ·∏•, ·∏´, ·∫ñ, ≈°, q (not ·∏≥) must be used. ìáã is transliterated as j, ìáãìáã as y. The character ìè≠ should not be transcribed, as it is usually a diacritic, not a consonant (see [Kilani 2019](references/bibliography.md)). In the case of late Egyptian spellings with extra final w (i.e. w-orthography spellings), the w should be ignored and not transcribed, as it does not indicate a consonant (see [Kilani 2019](references/bibliography.md)). Final consonants in weak verbs should be transcribed as j and w.

```python
EgyptianRoot = "s·∏èm"
```

### Input - Group Writing

Group Writing spellings should be organized chronologically according to their periods of attestations (see [Kilani 2019](references/bibliography.md)), namely:

18th dyn. - Ramses II (included) = Period 1
After Ramses II - 20th dyn (included) = Period 2
21st dyn - 22nd dyn (included) = Period 3
After 22nd dyn = Period 4

They must be input as unicode strings and transliterated according to the system suggested in [Kilani 2019](references/bibliography.md). In particular:

* Cw groups should be transliterated as CU (where C = any consonant, also below)
* CÍú£ groups should be transliterated as CA
* the sign ìè≠ should be transliterated as  ∏
* the group ‚ÄãìÇììè§ should be transliterated as kU
* the group ‚ÄãìÇßìè≠ should be transliterated as dU
* the group ‚ÄãìÖììÇù should be transliterated as mA
* the group ‚Äãìè≠ìÇãìè§ should be transliterated as  ∏r
* the group ‚Äãìàñìè• should be transliterated as n-


```python
GW_Period_1 = "yA.mA"
GW_Period_2 = "yA.mA"
GW_Period_3 = "yU.mA"
GW_Period_4 = "yU.mA"
```

### Group Writing Vocalization

The following conventions are employed in the fields of the output relating to Group Writing spellings.

* …• = used as IPA transcription of ìáãìáã = <y>, to distinguish it from ìáã = j 

* ƒÅ2 = vowel /ƒÅ/ next to k, may be spelled with U already in Period 1 (see Kilani 2019)
* a2 = vowel /a/ next to k, may be spelled with U already in Period 1 and 2 (see Kilani 2019)
* a3 = vowel /a/ next to  ï and etymological pharyngeals, it does not not undergo the shift /a/ > /o/

* U = back vowel, spelled with w (see [Kilani 2019](references/bibliography.md))
* A = non-back vowel or no vowel, spelled with Íú£ or with nothing (see [Kilani 2019](references/bibliography.md))
* ∆Ü = A after /k/, possibly realized as a back vowel (see [Kilani 2019](references/bibliography.md))

* [ = the vowel must be read after the associated consonant.
* ] = the vowel must be read before the associated consonant.
* \> ... < = the vowel must be read either before (marked with > ) or after (marked with < ) the associated consonants, but not in both places.

* \# = beginning of the word
* $ = end of the word
* | = phoneme separator
* ‚§´ = no vowel after the associated consonant
* 0 = empty slot
* a2 = vowel /a/ after /k/, possibly realized as a back vowel (see [Kilani 2019](references/bibliography.md))
* ƒÅ2 = vowel /ƒÅ/ after /k/, possibly realized as a back vowel (see [Kilani 2019](references/bibliography.md))

* VocCat: each number indicates a distinct vowel in a given position, the first slot being after the first consonant. The presence of the same number in more than one slot indicates that the corresponding vowel may be read and either of the slots (but not in both).
